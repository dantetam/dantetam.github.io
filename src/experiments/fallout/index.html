        <h3>Fallout as a Social Critique &emsp;<a href="#">PDF</a></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Dante Tam, 10/27/2017</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>The video game series Fallout deeply explores the paranoid consumerism of the Cold War era,<br> 
        through fun, immersive game mechanics, and a rich lore illustrating a horrific, life-like fantasy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Fallout universe, the world has not culturally advanced beyond the 1950s, with vacuum tube computers,</p>
        <p>lack of a counterculture movement, etc. A Cold War paranoia continues from the end of WWII, all the way to the late 21st century,</p>
        <p>where large fallout shelters, Vaults, have been built across America.</p>
        <p>Thermonuclear war ensues, and the world wakes up to a new reality of irradiated animals, savage tribespeople, <br>
        and the breakdown of civilization and its replacement with quasi-legitimate states and communities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the surface, Fallout quite obviously portrays and satirizes historical Cold War era culture.<br>
        In the commonness and ubiquity of "pre-War" goods like Nuka-Cola and "Cram" (derived from Spam),<br>
        this world establishes a parallel to our own — a world of brands and factory made products.<br>
        There are many types of drugs, cocktails, and stimulants across the Wasteland, which represent<br>
        the growing narcotics and substance abuse health issues in the past and in the present-day US.<br>
        Vault "culture" is particularly strong. The Vaults are distinct only in their undying, monolithic structure.<br>
        They are identical down to the design, manufacturer, Vault attire (Vault jumpsuits) — save for the vault number.<br>
        The premise is still the same in each numbered vault: to live a calm, sterile life, away from the madness of the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <blockquote>
            <p>When the rate of return on capital<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> exceeds the rate of growth of output and income<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>...</p>
            <p>capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities</p>
            <p>that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are nevertheless ways democracy can regain control over capitalism</p>
            <p>and ensure that the general interest takes precedence over private interests,</p>
            <p>while preserving economic openness and avoiding protectionist and nationalist reactions,</p>
            <p>[namely a progressive global wealth tax]. (Piketty 1)</p>
