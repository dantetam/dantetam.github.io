        <h3>Thomas Piketty: Capital in the Twenty-First Century &emsp;<a href="./PikettyReviewDanteTam.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Dante Tam, 8/12/2017</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Piketty's bestseller <u>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</u> opens readers' eyes to the great inequalities in the distribution of wealth forming globally.</p>
        <p>It is thoroughly dense, yet approachable for most readers. The arguments are well-organized and supported by strong data and methodology.</p>
        <p>Yet, it has been named the nation's most unread bestseller<sup><a href="#fn0" id="ref0">0</a></sup>, weighing at 600 pages; so, in this review, we condense his thesis and evidence.</p>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <blockquote>
            <p>When the rate of return on capital<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> exceeds the rate of growth of output and income<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>...</p>
            <p>capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities</p>
            <p>that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are nevertheless ways democracy can regain control over capitalism</p>
            <p>and ensure that the general interest takes precedence over private interests,</p>
            <p>while preserving economic openness and avoiding protectionist and nationalist reactions,</p>
            <p>[namely a progressive global wealth tax]. (Piketty 1)</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Piketty's argument is more of a restatement of past history and observation of the fundamental, intuitive nature of wealth:</p>
        <p>those who accumulate income from capital will concentrate more wealth than laborers working for wage income.</p>
        <p>It is also summed up in the inequality</p>
        <p>$$ r > g $$</p>
        <p>where $r$ is the rate<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> of return on capital, and $g$ is the rate of economic growth.</p>
        <p>Compounded over time, the r-g gap creates a great difference in income from capital and income from labor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We can see this gap with the real growth of wealth and income in recent decades: </p>
        <p>the top decile's share of income and wealth has gone up, while the bottom wages have stagnated.</p>
        <p>The wealth of capital owners at the top will skyrocket, while the poorer half of society will have almost nothing.</p>
        <p>A society with little growth will place an importance in already existing, inherited, and accumulated wealth.</p>
        <p>This society becomes greatly inegalitarian, less democratic and meritocratic, and more unstable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The historical data used in Piketty's argument can be summed up as follows:</p>
        <p>the Industrial Revolution led to a massive concentration of wealth, and income inequality,</p>
        <p>as well as a high capital to income ratio (meaning that most of the income came from financial assets and investments;</p>
        <p>the World Wars destroyed most capital and led to high growth, progressive income taxes,  and government policy (intervention to statism);</p>
        <p>and, a conservative revolution further away from WWII, with the law above in mind, led to deregulation and wealth concentration.</p>

        <br>
        <p>This leads to massive wealth and income inequality, with the top centile in the UK,</p>
        <p>owns 30% of all wealth, implying that an individual in this group owns 30x the average wealth.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Using the postwar taxes and regulations as a base, Piketty argues that a global, progressive wealth tax can greatly reduce inequality.</p>
        <p>To review: a high saving and reinvestment rate leads to the accumulation of capital over time, causing an 'endless inegalitarian spiral'.</p>
        <p>A progressive wealth tax slows the saving rate and accumulation, and shifts capital into public hands.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The biggest takeaway from the data and arguments, and the least controversial, is that wealth inequality will continue to worsen,</p>
        <p>and people need to take action. In this sense, Piketty sets in motion a groundwork for studying the causes and data of inequality.</p>
