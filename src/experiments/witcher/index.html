        <h3>The Witcher (<i>Blood of Elves</i>, <i>The Time of Contempt</i> ) Review &emsp;<!--<a href="./404.pdf">PDF</a>--></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Dante Tam, 1/17/2018</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>The Witcher medieval fantasy book series, by Andrezj Sapkowski, illustrates a beautiful Tolkien-esque world while adding a more 'human', real morality, as well as an everpresent sense of politics and a powerful and manipulative political world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Many successful, invigorating, and newer fantasy series explore deeper moral choices, which are inherently more interesting and human. <i>The Time of Contempt</i> introduces a world that has been become ravaged by non-human prejudice, political tension, and escalating violence; this setting provides insight into the main characters' response to adversity. Geralt, the main character in an intertwined set of third person narratives, is the witcher, a contracted monster slayer sworn to political neutrality and the protection of humans and innocents. He talks to Codringher, a shady information broker, who introduces himself as a 'modern witcher', and takes in massive amounts of coin in exchange for his own moral integrity. The back-and-forth between the two illustrates their own deeply opposing views on their circumstances, and their moral conflict (or lack thereof) in fighting back. Codringher argues that the violent nature of their time justifies the use of underhanded methods, the sacrifice of innocents, and outright violence, to protect themselves and their loved ones. Geralt refuses to partake in Codringher's proposed plan, remarking,</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>'And who am I free to despise?' interrupted the Witcher.<br>'Am I to pay for what I love with contempt for myself? No, Codringher.'<br> (Andrezj Sapkowski, David French translation, 34)</p>
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Sapkowski explores this relationship between aesthetics and one's own perceived moral self-worth. He contrasts their opposing end-goals and methods to achieve them, with their own introspective moral integrity. This sets the stage for the deeper moral conflict and further adversity that Geralt faces later on in a 'time of contempt.' The author plays with the facades of higher political discourse and social carousing, and breaks them down to reveal more primitive human behaviors and basic urges of competition and violence.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1 (Minor spoiler.)</a></sup></p>
        <br>
        <p>Sapkowski builds a high fantasy world in the legacy of Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Tolkien literature greatly contributes to the fantasy genre through the creation of fantasy races. Elves, dwarves, and orcs are satirical, idealized caricatures of humans. In Tolkien literature, the elves are a higher humanoid race with great power, moral perfection, and physical 'infallibility.' In <i>The Witcher</i> series, Sapkowski upsets this balance of power, by building a more morally gray and violent world. The elves greatly value and pursue cultural and magical (i.e. 'scientific') knowledge, but lose their civilization and initial dominance to the industrious, violent, and brutish humans. <i>The Witcher</i>'s illustrious vision of the Tolkien world brings new life to the high fantasy genre.</p>
