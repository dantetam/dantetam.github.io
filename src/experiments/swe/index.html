    <h3>The World of Software Engineering</h3>
    <br>
    <p><i>Dante Tam, 5/2/2018</i></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p><b>What is the software engineering job market like? I'm hearing many differing and conflicting truths about SWE job prospects.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>
      tl; dr: There are many candidates with technical 'transferable' skills, but on the other side, many companies that want highly qualified and experienced candidates. There is both a saturation and a shortage within the SWE job market.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The main problem in the current CS pipeline is that CS programs are not teaching students in <i>immediately</i> beneficial programs. There is a great disconnect between what CS students ought to learn from an academic standpoint,
      and what skills are needed in the SWE workspace. Most CS programs disregard or actively choose to avoid modern SWE applications, such as node.js, or advanced git control.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Companies can afford to leave SWE positions to find better and outwardly more qualified candidates.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p><b>What's the breakdown of a SWE's qualifications?</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, this is up to the companies and their hiring managers. It's a balanced mix of being both outwardly likable and technically knowledgeable. Qualifications are not a perfect recipe for being hired but more of
      a guide to hiring managers to decide to hire qualified candidates.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Hiring managers and interviewers will ask "Is this person objectively qualified for the job?" as well as "Would I enjoy working with person?". I divide SWE qualifications into four broad groups:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Technical Skills: Resume "Pedigree", <br>
      Technical Skills: Technical Knowledge, <br>
      Interpersonal Skills: Communicating Information, <br>
      Interpersonal Skills: Personability <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Immediately when recruiters and hiring managers review a resume, they begin to judge the person's 'pedigree.' The following lists are ordered from greatest perceived importance to least.
    Experience: Top tier experience, regular experience, educational experience/volunteering. Education: School honors, target schools, four-year colleges. Technical experience related to job posting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Companies obviously need technically qualified candidates. They use phone and onsite technical interviews to directly see learned knowledge and applicable skills.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is the more subjective learning that must be shown to hiring managers: the ability to communicate information clearly and fluently show proficiency. Great software engineering skills must always
    be complemented by great technical communication skills, since software engineering is inherently collaborative. This is why companies are interested in not only the technical smarts of candidates,
    but also their ability to communicate findings, insights, and algorithms. Companies use whiteboard interviews and technical screens to achieve this.</p>
