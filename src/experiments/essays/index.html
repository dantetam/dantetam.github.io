        <h3>CESRI: The Formulaic Way of Writing Analytical Essays</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Dante Tam, 11/30/2017</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>For when you're writing your analytic, argumentative, thesis-based essays, here's a quick way to structure your arguments. This is so you can focus on thinking about arguments,<br>
        and not about the tedious details of essay organization. I feel that essay structure is taught too infrequently in high schools and colleges.</p>
        
        <p>The general idea: move from coarse, observational, to fine-tuned, and analytical. Here's the CESRI structure:</p>
        
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <blockquote>
            
            <p><b>C</b>laim: the point you are proving or the analysis you are outlining. This should relate back to and directly support your thesis.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The industrial processes of food production distance people from their nourishment, both literally and in a sociological sense.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><b>E</b>vidence: the exact piece of evidence you are citing and analyzing. Choose evidence from a reputable source that provides room for expansion and deep thought.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the New York Times article "When a Crop Becomes King",<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Pollan details the widespread (mis)uses of corn in nearly all modern food products... (remember to cite quotes properly)</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><b>S</b>ummary: an optional place to clarify, emphasize, or detail your evidence - important for citing large quotes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Pollan details the massive food production industries built around corn cultivation.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><b>R</b>easoning: the deep analysis of the evidence in support of your claim. This is the meat of your essay, and where you shine and show off your brilliant mind.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Pollan uses corn as a vehicle to analyze the greater industrialization of American food production,<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the economic structures necessary to support a modern society of heavy consumption.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><b>I</b>nterpretation: the "extra" analysis of your points. Being the last impression you leave on a reader,<br> 
            this is the perfect time to add your opinions, significances, relations to course materials, expansions to further analysis, and transitions to establish your next points.<br>
            This is also a great way to add to your unique "voice". 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I find these hideous structures of agricultural power as a necessary evil in a modern convenience-based society...<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [...which has created the great distance in food and people we have studied in this course.]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [...which has so greatly diverged from natural existence.]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [...which heavily relies on commercial brands to establish quick, artificial bonds of trust between consumers and producers. This is discussed in Pillsbury, where...]</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        And that's it. Simply follow this formula all the way to proving your point.<br>
        Develop a good point, find good evidence, figure out how it proves your point, and then prove your point.<br>
        Bonus points for strong verbs, specific nouns, descriptive adjectives, flowing transitions, and unique voice.<br>
        The structure is open to interpretation. Write for your own enjoyment.<br>
        </p>
        
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
