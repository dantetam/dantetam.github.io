    <h3>Affirmative Action in 2020: An Editorial Deep Dive into the University of California</h3>
    <br>
    <p><i>Dante Tam, 10/7/2020</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>The passage of Proposition 16 in California would enable affirmative action in public state institutions. It attempts to overturn Prop 209, which California voters passed in 1996 to ban the consideration of race. These measures greatly affect the University of California system, which must choose its criteria for ranking candidates.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    We will discuss affirmative action as the consideration of race in the enrollment process at the UC system. 'Underrepresented minority' (URM), is an engineered term unique to the UC system and refers to any non-White ethnicity that has less share in enrollment than its share of the state's population. Prop 209 greatly decreased African American and Latino admissions. For both UC Berkeley and UCLA, admit rates dropped from 7% in 1997 to 3% in 1998, the first year of Prop 209's enforcement.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> URM graduation rates increased greatly in the immediate aftermath of Prop 209. <sup><a href="#fn1">2</a></sup> This sudden change over a year reveals the massive scope of discrimination in admissions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Race in admissions leads to uncomfortable situations in which more qualified non-URM applicants will be discarded in favor of URM applicants. Affirmative action supporters call for race to be considered alongside high school grades, AP courses, and extracurricular activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Elsewhere in the fight for affirmative action, UCB and UCLA both have race-based outreach programs to high schools. I discuss this, because even though </p>
    
    <p><i>It is very disheartening that many of the statistical websites providing historical data on UC admissions (UCOP historical records, UC statfinder) have been dismantled over the years for unknown reasons. I had have to use these other sources that cite the now defunct data websites.</i></p>
