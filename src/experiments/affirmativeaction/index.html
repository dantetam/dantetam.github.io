        <h3>Affirmative Action, An Opinion Piece &emsp;<a href="./PikettyReviewDanteTam.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Dante Tam, 12/19/2017</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Building better schools for the children and advocating for greater education are non-partisan issues in America.
        Yet, access to higher education, as well as its equitability, and even the definition of equitability, divide the nation's
        political psyche, and represents an issue of contention in a larger, societal conflict over the idea of fairness.
        </p>
        <p>
        Affirmative action is the general practice of favoring historically advantaged groups, mainly to lessen societal disparities,
        and lessen observed socioeconomic inequality across certain groups, such as ethnicity and gender.
        Affirmative action, while good-natured, is ultimately both divisive and ineffective, as it serves a distraction
        from truly fixing the K-12 pipeline, investing in higher education, and developing concrete plans of action to attack disparity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Both sides can agree that we should increase access to education and live in a fair meritocracy (those who attack meritocracy
        are not attacking fairness, they attack its implementation in the real world). <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Affirmative action has seen use with and without quotas. Quotas have been struck down as unconstitutional and represent
        much of the problem with AA: a numbers-based approach to forcing equity, in a discriminatory way. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Still, AA today is effectively the same. Without increasing the number of college seats, inevitably, someone objectively more
        qualified must be turned down in favor of someone else. While the college selection process is not completely fair and perfect,
        it should be not adjust itself again in the opposite direction of racial inequality — the actual disparity, such as the SAT test,
        should be inspected and fixed.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Furthermore, <b>society as a whole must stop divesting from higher education</b>. Higher education spending has declined dramatically
        over the past few decades, and especially even in recent years. Meanwhile, tuition, and student debt, explode as a result.
        Public higher education is one of the greatest government forces in social equity and economic mobility, and it seems
        that divestment from this public good seems to only provoke the powerful interest group of broke college students.
        The overwhelming motivation of state governments' higher education subsidies is neither of goodwill nor of a passion for learning,
        but rather an objective acknowledgement that highly educated citizens net a positive externality for the state,
        and form the base of greater economic and technological productivity.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>We must fix the K-12 schooling system</b>, the (leaky) pipeline which transforms young children into productive, well-adjusted adults.
        College applications are the fair judgments of an inherently unfair K-12 system. Across states and state lines, counties and neighborhoods within
        are divided by vast disparities in quality of K-12 education, as well as in access to college-prep resources, both formal and informal.
        I define <i>formal</i> college resources as those directly intended to help: college counselors, SAT prep courses, community college enrollment
        programs, K-12 STEM outreach, and so on. Yet, we must also focus our attention on the "informal" preparation for college: a culture of accomplishment,
        school and afterschool food programs, a legacy of higher education within the family, access to digital resources, etc. — all of which
        have ranging degrees of subjectivity and "fluidity".<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        One of the most objective, productive, and least divisive issues to address within society is <b>mending the digital divide</b>. Most often, when we
        hear of innovation in improving accessability to the Internet, it is in far away, lesser-developed emerging economies. Still, equitable and
        viable access to internet remains a significant issue in America, as a part of its larger rural-urban divide. Particularly, disregarding
        politics, it seems that this inequitable access is a matter of physics and economics: it simply costs too much for internet providers
        to develop high-speed broadband for sparse, rural areas, without government subsidies. 35% of rural citizens, or 22 million Americans,
        do not have access to high speed internet. This slows down the entire pipeline and the general functioning of a 21st century information society.
